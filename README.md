Welcome to this Power bi project. 
This is a guided project with some instructions on measures. but i've created a few more measures which gave me few more visuals to work with and some insights as well.
Project was about the markets in countries in USA, MEX and CAN. I've drilled down yearly trends to weekly trends. which small regions is contributing more to revenue and profits.
I've used line charts to show trends and funnel charts to show the comparison by profit margin across top 5 product brands.
You can check the project in the repositories. 
Thanks :)
